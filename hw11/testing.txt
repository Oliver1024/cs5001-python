# test the following functions
    Board:
        draw_board():
            Give appropriate values to see if it can draw a board like 2*2 grid
            the result is correct

    Disk:
        draw_disk():
            Individually run in processing, change self.x and self.y to see if this function can draw a circle with
            different x and y
            the result is correct

    GameController:
        __init__():
            Change self.w and self.h, to see if self.grid can come out with different list of list, which are all None value
            valid input 1: self.w = 2, self.h = 3
            self.grid = [[None, None], [None, None]]
            valid input 2: self.w = 3, self.h = 4
            self.grid = [[None, None, None], [None, None, None], [None, None, None]]
            the result is correct

        draw_me():
            Give different mouseX and mouseY to see if it can draw_disk and draw_board correctly
            Simulate mouse clicking on different areas of the board
            get the great result and can draw correctly

        draw_disks():
            Give different mouseX and mouseY to see if the disk can drop down correctly as expected
            Simulate mouse clicking on different areas of the board
            get the great result and can drop down correctly

        get_available_row():
            Input different column values to see if the function can return expected row or -1
            Test several times
            h = 2, row = 1, column = 1, return row = 1
            the testing result is correct

        next_player():
            Test given either red or yellow, the returned result is good

        area_detected():
            Test click different area of board and to see if return the expected boolean value
            and see in the console of processing, if it prints True when the mouse is put in the legal area,
            and False if the mouse is put in illegal area.
            the result is correct

        check_column_full():
            Check the top row of board is empty or not
            test results is according to the expected value if the top row is None and return False and is not None, return True
            The result is good

        game_over()
            Print certain text if the game is over
            individually run in processing, to see if the function can show the text in the right way.
            the outcome is good
        
        check_game_over()
            Check row is None and return False, and is not None return True
            testing result is good
