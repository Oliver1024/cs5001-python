Exercise 1: The robot typist

set x is integer
x represent the various message lines, assuming that x is greater than one line, type each line to fill it with new lines

	if x  > 1
		then get the real input line is integer y int((25-x)/2)
	elif x <= 1
		then get the real input line is integer y (25+1)/2 
	
Exercise 2: Remainders

set any two integer number a, b
set remainder is integer c,
times is integer d

if a > b
	then a % b, c is the remainder and d is the times
	then we can get the remainder is c == a - b*d
elif a = b
	then the remainder c is 0
elif a < b
	then b % a, c is the remainder and d is the times
	the we can get the remainder is c == b - a*d

Exercise 3: Triangle types

As we know, a^2+b^2<c^2 >90 degree OBTUSE TRIANGLE
                       a^2+b^2=c^2 =90 degree  RIGHT TRIANGLE
                       a^2+b^2>c^2 <90 degree ACUTE TRIANGLE

set the three sides of the triangle is length = [a,b,c],length[i] is a random side
           if int(length[0]*length[0]) == int(length[1]*length[1]) + int(length[2]*length[2])
		     then print("This triangle is â€™RIGHT TRIANGLE'")
	   elif int(length[0]*length[0]) > int(length[1]*length[1]) + int(length[2]*length[2])
	             then print("This triangle is 'OBTUSE TRIANGLE''') 
	   elif int(length[0]*length[0]) < int(length[1]*length[1]) + int(length[2]*length[2])
	             then print("This triangle is 'ACUTE TRIANGLE'")
	   elif length[0] == length[1] && length[1]== length[2]
	             then print("This triangle is 'EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE'")
	   elif length[0] == length[1] || length[1]== length[2] || length[0] == length[2]
	             then print("This triangle is 'ISOSCELES TRIANGLE'")
	   elif length[0] != length[1] != length[2]
	             then print('This triangle is 'SCALENE TRIANGLE'")

Exercise 4: The radio show

set the first call k, time is a, response right answer time is b
the total response time is c = a+b

if the following person call k+i, call time is m, the following response answer time is n, i = i+1
        if m+ n > c
		then write c is on the business card
	 elif m + n = c
	      	then write c is on the business card
	 elif m + n < c
		then write the result of m + n on the business card, and compare the time(t) of the person who made the call later with m+n
			if  t is less than m + n
				then write the t on the business card
			elif keep the m + n
			
Exercise 5: Dot-to-dot transmission

messaging protocol with partner: each time my partner determines the position according to the given polar coordinate value

scan and plan the coordinates of each point (x,y)
	then store each result of the scan in a pre-defined array[(x1,y1),1]
	pass this array to my partner, and tell this is his coordinates, and the number behind represents the order
		for i=0; i++; i<=75
			then cycle through the entire range of numbers and mark the given [(x, y), i]
			then read the numbers in order, and mark the coordinate positions in order
			then connect in numerical order

Exercise 6: Celebrity finder

define the number of people at the party as m
Randomly pick 2 people from m to ask:"Does X know Y?"

	if no one knows Y, 
	then continue to grab one from the rest and ask the same question
	then repeat the above questioning method until m-1 times
        finally, it takes m-1 times at most to identify the celebrity

Exercise 7: Poker hands

define 52 poker cards as a set {color, number}
mark the order of 10 sets of poker cards from left to right and top to bottom as numbers 1 to 10
then randomly select 5 cards as the first set s1{color, number}, and the second set s2{color, number}
first determine the set s, which is the position of the array [0]
then put all of them in a temporary array a[x] for judgment

	if a[x] is a flush and a straight flush
	then compare between 1 and 2 set
	elif they are the flush, which is belong set 5
        if a[x] is a none-flush
		elif a[x] is four of a kind
			then a[x] belongs set 3
		elif a[x] has three same numbers and if the left also have two same numbers
			then a[x] belongs set 4, full house
			else a[x] belongs set 7, three of a kind
		elif a[x] has serial numbers
			then a[x] belongs set 6, straight
		elif a[x] has two pair of numbers
			then a[x] belongs set 8, two pair
		elif a[x] has only one pair of numbers
			then a[x] belongs set 9, pair
		else a[x] belongs set 10, high card
	use the same method again to determine the element of the set s at position s[1]
        finally can get s1 and s2 size
