1. In Listing 5.4 (addnonnegatives.py) could the condition of the if statement have used > instead of
>= and achieved the same results? Why?
Yes, we can replace >= with >, and the result is the same. 
Because the replacement does not affect the program execution logic.

2. In Listing 5.4 (addnonnegatives.py) could the condition of the while statement have used > instead
of >= and achieved the same results? Why?
No, it doesn't get the same results. Because the replacement will change the program execution logic and while loop will 
never be executed. So, Sum will always be zero.

3. In Listing 5.4 (addnonnegatives.py) what would happen if the statement entry = int(input()) # Get the value
were moved out of the loop? Is moving the assignment out of the loop a good or bad thing to do?
Why?
It is bad thing to do. Get the value were moved out of the loop, the while loop will become a an infinite loop.
And print will never be executed.
