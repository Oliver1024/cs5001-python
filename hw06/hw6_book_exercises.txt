1. Yes, it is a legal Python program.

2. Yes, it is a legal Python program.

3. Yes, it is a legal Python program.

4. Yes, it is a legal Python program.

5. No, it is not a legal Python program. Because this program will get
a TypeError: "proc() missing 1 required positional argument: 'y'".

6. No, it is not a legal Python program. Because this program will get
a TypeError: proc() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given.

7. Yes, it is a legal Python program.

8. In fact it will print 10 instead of 200. Because num=10 is in the local scope of the main 
function, first the actual parameter of num=10 is passed to the function proc(x), 
and the calculation shows that x=200, and finally the main function print(num=10), 
so the result is still 10.

9. Yes, it is legal. Because x is a local variable, the scope of action is only in a certain function, 
so different functions can use the same variable name without affecting each other.

10. Yes, it is legal. Because of the actual parameter y, when the main function calls the proc() function, 
the actual parameter y is passed to the formal parameter x to get the return value of the calling function.
